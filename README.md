Data Analysis
March 19, 2023
Project Plan Scope
I have hand recorded information
into an excel spreadsheet. The data
supplied are receipts collected by a
client for 6 months. The client is
seeking answers about how much
money has been spent from August
2022 to February 2023
Questions
Total amount spent in 6 months
Top 5 stores where the money was spent
Top 2 used Payment methods
Top 3 items purchased at Top #1 store
Once all data is reviewed, these projections will
show the spending habits, amounts, and how one
retail organization can control the flow of this client's
income.
